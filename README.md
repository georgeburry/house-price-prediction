# Predicting Boston house prices

Scikit-learn includes a default dataset to work with called Boston House Prices. I simply cleaned the data, reduced and scaled the features, and trained a number of regression models and predicted prices to see which model would offer the best result. I achieved this by looping through the models and adding them into a pipeline each time.
